The implementation is designed to be modular, allowing you to start with basic functionality and gradually add advanced features. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation while providing clear upgrade paths.
Estimated Timeline: 6-8 months for full implementation with a dedicated team of 3-4 developers.
Key Technologies: Python/Flask, React/Three.js, TensorFlow/PyTorch, EnergyPlus, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and various AI/ML libraries.
This system would compete with commercial building design tools while providing unique AI-powered optimization capabilities and real-time collaboration features.
